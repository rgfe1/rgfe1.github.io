        <p> <span class="boldInfo">Mi name is Francy.</span> I have a degree in Industrial Engineering but am trying to transition careers towards tech and web development. At the moment, I am taking classes to gain the skills necessary to make great websites,
          web apps, and in time finish up the certificate in Web Development and start working in this growing, interesting field. I am very motivated to continue having a positive impact on people’s lives. I love being in nature, walking, listening to
          music, running, reading, learning… practicing simple and motivating things.
        </p>
        <p>I'm really excited to see where these new skills will take me whether I'm eventually developing websites or programming and positively impacting people's lives!
