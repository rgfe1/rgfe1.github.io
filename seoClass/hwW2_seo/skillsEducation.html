          <p>Some of the ways I use to update my knowledge in technology are taking classes, reading, and coding. Above you can see the list of the different classes I have taken so far. At the moment, I am focusing on the classes that correspond to the
            certificate in Advanced web development techniques.</p>
          <p>I am very inspired by the huge potential that technology plays in our lives, then my invitation is to find the options that cultivate and elevate our spirit.</p>
