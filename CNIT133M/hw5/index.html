            <li>The builds can crash without any reason like a corrupted original folder.</li>
            <li>If you are building hybrid applications, then you may face security issues, and your code may be prone to hackers.</li>
            <li>If you are starting with an ionic framework, then you have to be dependent on plugins to access the native functionalities.</li>
            <li>There may be some performance issues when building complex and heavy mobile applications.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>(Also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Languages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Javascript</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> You can easily build mobile apps using JavaScript with react native and it provides you the same design as react that lets you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.</li>
              <li><strong>UI-Focused:</strong> Provides a good responsive design with great rendering abilities.</li>
              <li><strong>Development Time:</strong> Development Services time is considerably very short compare to other platforms in the market.</li>
              <li><strong>Tried and Trusted:</strong> You only have to put building blocks together using JavaScript, because it uses the same fundament UI building blocks as regular android application & iOS application.</li>

              <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Today, it is one of the popular platforms by the developers contributing from all over the globe leading to a strong community presence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Use the Framework?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>One codebase for two platforms:</strong> With React Native, you create one codebase that works on both Android and iOS.</li>
            <li><strong>Use the language you already know:</strong> You need less specialized knowledge to create React Native apps.</li>
            <li><strong>Growing all the time:</strong> React Native is under active development. Both Facebook and the massive community around React Native are constantly working on improvements for the framework.</li>
            <li><strong>Save even more time with a web app:</strong> If you have a ReactJS web app, fragments of the frontend code (such as business logic) can be shared between mobile and web, facilitating development even more.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time and cost efficiency</li>
            <li>Native look and feel of your apps</li>
            <li>Sharing the codebase for iOS, Android, and the Web (with ReactXP and React Native for Web)</li>
            <li>One team for multiple platforms</li>
            <li>Awesome performance</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Need for an expertise from a native developer for some platform-specific modules</li>
            <li>It’s not fully cross-platform, single-codebase approach</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

            <p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>This toolkit is a cross-platform technology from Google, that allows creating application programs for mobile, desktop, and web use. Most importantly, it is open-source and completely free.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Languages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Dart</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Integration, Flexibility and Scalability Capabilities:</strong> Because of it’s easy to access and easy to integrate framework, Google’s Flutter provides enhanced flexibility, integration and scalability capabilities.</li>
              <li><strong>Hot Reload:</strong> Allows developers to render change in sub-seconds. In the long haul, it saves time, money and efforts – everything.</li>
              <li><strong>One Stop Solution:</strong> Provides one stop solution to develop, deploy and manage change. It means that one can build effective UIs, deploy them in the system and if there are any bugs or changes, they can be observed as well as fixed easily from Flutter.</li>
              <li><strong>Native Performance and Internationalised Flutter Libraries:</strong> One can get to use widgets that can integrate all the platform based functionalities of the application such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts. Provides effective native experience based on the platform i.e. android or iOS and it also aids in developing standardised and effective UIs based on the geographic locations.</li>
              <li><strong>Huge Widget Library:</strong> Developers can build applications faster because of its impeccable ready to use widget collection. One can select widgets based on the platform, nature of the applications as well as the geographical locations where the application will be deployed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why Use the Framework?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast development:</strong> Engineered for high development velocity.</li>
            <li><strong>Expressive + Flexible UI:</strong> Flutter moves to a widget, rendering, animation and gestures into this framework to give complete control over every pixel on the screen. It means one have the flexibility to build a custom design.</li>
            <li><strong>Native apps for Android and IOS:</strong> Follow platform conventions and interface details such as scrolling, navigation, icons, fonts, etc. That's why apps built with Flutter features on both of the Appstore and Google Play Store.</li>
            <li><strong>Hot Reload:</strong> Just hit a refresh and your codes also refresh.</li>
            <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> It doesn’t require a Javascript bridge and the speed is much faster.</li>
            <li><strong>Using Dart as a Programming Language:</strong> It is a comfortable language and uses a lot of CSS parts as well. Dart uses for generational garbage collection which helps in creating frames for short-lived objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce the Third Parties:</strong> One can get complete IOS experience or Android Experience. So they are reducing the Third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>API. The Flutter API is very consistent:</strong> Anything is a widget. A button can use as a screen, a full page used as a button with animation and transformation.</li>
            <li><strong>The customizable kit of Widgets:</strong> Rich and customizable set of widgets for Android, IOS and Material Design. This help to create smooth, crisp and refined app experience as are available with a native app.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
            <li>Similarity to native app performance</li>
            <li>Suitable for web and desktop browsers</li>
            <li>Own graphics engine</li>
            <li>Simple logic implementation</li>
            <li>Great designs</li>
            <li>Customizable kit of widgets</li>
            <li>Hot reloading function</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>There are fewer libraries (and information) than for native development</li>
            <li>The final installation package is larger</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
