          <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
          <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed down quilt and gas-fired stove. It includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
          <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
          <p>A sense of adventure and some time to relax! You should also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</p>
